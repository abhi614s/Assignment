'''
Write a program to construct a dictionary from the two lists containing the names of students and their corresponding subjects. The dictionary should map the students with their respective subjects. Letâ€™s see how to do this using for loops and dictionary comprehension.

'''

students = ["Alice", "Bob", "Charlie"]
subjects = ["Math", "Science", "English"]

student_subjects_dict = {}

for i in range(len(students)):
    student_subjects_dict[students[i]] = subjects[i]

print(student_subjects_dict)
