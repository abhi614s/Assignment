# Create a Time class and initialize it with hours and minutes.
# Create a method addTime which should take two Time objects and add them. E.g.- (2 hour and 50 min)+(1 hr and 20 min) is (4 hr and 10 min)
# Create another method displayTime which should print the time.
# Also create a method displayMinute which should display the total minutes in the Time.
# E.g.- (1 hr 2 min) should display 62 minutes.
